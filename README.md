Key Problems
1. Network Downtime and Outages
Frequent Outages: Solana has experienced several network downtimes, some of which lasted for hours. These outages disrupt the functionality of decentralized applications (dApps) and impact the trust of users.
Causes: Network congestion, bugs in the software, and DDoS attacks have been some of the causes of these downtimes.
Solution Exploration: Ongoing efforts to improve the network’s resilience and avoid future downtimes.
2. Scalability Limitations
Transaction Load: Solana’s blockchain, while fast, has had issues with handling large transaction volumes, especially during periods of high demand. Although it boasts high throughput, its current architecture struggles when facing extreme congestion.
Potential Solutions: The network needs further optimization in its scalability model, considering the long-term growth of dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi).
3. Centralization Concerns
Validator Centralization: The Solana network is criticized for being too centralized, with a significant proportion of validators being controlled by a small number of entities. This could undermine the decentralization ethos of blockchain technology.
Validators’ Costs: The high cost of running a Solana validator (in terms of hardware requirements) leads to the centralization of the network’s validators, creating entry barriers for smaller participants.
